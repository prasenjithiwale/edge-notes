## [0.0.1] - 2026-09-14

The first release. macOS (universal: Apple Silicon and Intel) and Linux (x86_64).

### The widget

- A small floating tab docked to the left or right screen edge, above other apps.
  Point at it (or click it, if you prefer) and a panel of notes slides out; move
  away and it slides back.
- Drag the tab along the edge to place it. Keep open pins the panel out.
- Tray menu: open notes, new note, dock side, launch at login, quit.
- Global shortcut `Cmd+Alt+N` (`Ctrl+Alt+N` on Linux) for a new note.

### Notes

- Create, edit, delete with undo, search, and filter by colour.
- Sixteen note colours, readable in light and dark themes.
- Formatting kept as plain Markdown: bold, italic, strikethrough, bulleted and
  numbered lists, checklists you can tick from the card, and clickable links.
- Expand a note into a large panel to read or edit it comfortably.
- Lock a note to keep it at the top and read-only until you choose to edit it.
- Click outside an unchanged note to stop editing.
- Export every note as Markdown plus a JSON backup.
- Everything is stored locally in SQLite; nothing leaves your machine.

### Known limitations

- Not signed or notarised: macOS asks for confirmation the first time (see the
  release notes).
- On macOS, a panel opened with the shortcut needs one click before it takes
  typing.
- Linux runs under X11 or XWayland; native Wayland is not supported yet.
- Windows builds are not published yet.
